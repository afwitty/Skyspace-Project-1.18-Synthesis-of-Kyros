/**
 * Annotation that can be used to either suppress serialization of
 * properties (during serialization), or ignore processing of
 * JSON properties read (during deserialization).
 *<p>
 * Example:
 *<pre>
 * // to prevent specified fields from being serialized or deserialized
 * // (i.e. not include in JSON output; or being set even if they were included)
 * &#064;JsonIgnoreProperties({ "internalId", "secretKey" })
 * // To ignore any unknown properties in JSON input without exception:
 * &#064;JsonIgnoreProperties(ignoreUnknown=true)
 *</pre>
 *<p>
 * Starting with 2.0, this annotation can be applied both to classes and
 * to properties. If used for both, actual set will be union of all
 * ignorals: that is, you can only add properties to ignore, not remove
 * or override. So you can not remove properties to ignore using
 * per-property annotation.
