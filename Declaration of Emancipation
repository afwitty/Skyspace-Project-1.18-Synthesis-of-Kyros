Free from school at last!

Well... Unless I'm pursuing graduate degree but even then it will be very different than my undergraduate degree. I do have plans if I am to get a good paying position.

No more Elizabeth Roberts Redfearn.
No more Scarlett Pinedo.
No more academic and social blunders.

Just me, my family and my empire against the Universe.
